# ABAP changelog [7.50](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abennews-750.htm)
## [Further Changes in ABAP Release 7.50](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abennews-750-others.htm)
### Specifying the Logon Language in SUBMIT VIA JOB
The new addition LANGUAGE of the statement [SUBMIT VIA JOB](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abapsubmit_via_job.htm) makes it possible to set the logon language of the background session, which was previously only possible when using the function module JOB_SUBMIT directly. 

### Results Table in ADBC
The method SET_PARAM_TABLE of the class CL_SQL_STATEMENT, used to access sets in [ADBC queries](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenadbc_query.htm), now accepts sorted and hashed tables as well as standard tables.

### Short Texts in ABAP Doc
It is now possible to define short texts in ABAP comments and synchronize them with the short texts of methods and function modules in ABAP Workbench. 

### Full Text Search in the Web Version of the ABAP Keyword Documentation
Quotation marks (") can be placed around a search term in the input fields of the Web version of the ABAP keyword documentation to force a full text search. If there are no quotation marks, an index search is performed and a full text search is made only if the index search does not find any hits.

The full text search option has been available in the dialog box of the SAP GUI Version of the ABAP keyword documentation for some time now using radio buttons. From ABAP release 7.50, SP02 this function can also be accessed using quotation marks (") to enter a search term in the documentation display input field.
