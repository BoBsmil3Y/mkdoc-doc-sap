# ABAP changelog [7.50](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abennews-750.htm)

## [ABAP CDS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abennews-750-abap_cds.htm)
### CDS Table Functions 
The new DDL statement [DEFINE TABLE FUNCTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_f1_define_table_function.htm) can be used to define CDS table functions as a new category of CDS entities. In platform-specific SQL, a CDS table function is implemented in an associated AMDP function implementation. 

### CDS Access Control
ABAP CDS [access control](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_access_control.htm), introduced in ABAP release 7.40, SP10, was expanded to include implicit evaluations of CDS roles defined in the ABAP CDS [DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_f1_dcl_syntax.htm) in ABAP SQL. If a CDS entity is associated with a CDS role, an additional access condition is checked by default when the CDS entity is accessed using ABAP SQL. Only that data is read for which the current user has an authorization or that matches a literal condition. 

### Expressions and Functions
The following enhancements have been implemented:

- Enhancements to the [CAST expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_cast_expression_v1.htm) of a CDS view:
	- A CAST expression now contain nested cast expressions and [case distinctions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_case_expression_v1.htm) as an operand.
    - Data elements can now be specified as the target type in CAST expressions. This passes its semantic properties to the result. This also makes it possible to map more built-in types to itself than previously.
    - In CAST expressions, the restriction no longer applies that casts of operands of the types DEC, CURR, and QUAN to the same types expect the target type to be long enough. In casts from NUMC to NUMC, however, the lengths must now match exactly.
	- CAST expressions can now be used to cast operands of the types DATS and TIMS to CHAR (if the length of the target type is sufficient).
- A one character literal with the type NUMC can now be [compared](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_cond_expr_types_v1.htm) with a data source of the type LANG.
- New SQL functions for CDS views:
	- String functions: [CONCAT_WITH_SPACE, INSTR, LEFT, LENGTH, LTRIM, RIGHT, RPAD, RTRIM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_sql_functions_character_v1.htm)
	- Byte string functions: [BINTOHEX, HEXTOBIN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_conv_func_types_v1.htm)
- Date functions and time functions for CDS views:
	- The special date functions [DATS_DAYS_BETWEEN, DATS_ADD_DAYS, and DATS_ADD_MONTHS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_date_functions_v1.htm) make it possible to calculate with values of the built-in dictionary type [DATS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenddic_builtin_types.htm) in CDS views.
	- The new date function [DATS_IS_VALID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_date_functions_v1.htm) checks the validity of dates.
	- The new time function [TIMS_IS_VALID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_time_functions_v1.htm) checks the validity of times.
	- The new time stamp functions [TSTMP_IS_VALID, TSTMP_CURRENT_UTCTIMESTAMP, TSTMP_SECONDS_BETWEEN and TSTMP_ADD_SECONDS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_timestamp_functions_v1.htm) perform operations with [time stamps](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abentime_stamps_packed.htm) in packed numbers.
- [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_parameter_v1.htm) from the parameter list [parameter_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_parameter_list_v1.htm) of a CDS view can be passed to many arguments of [built-in functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_builtin_functions_v1.htm).
- In the [conversion functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_conversion_functions_v1.htm) UNIT_CONVERSION and DECIMAL_SHIFT, the result type was set to the data type [QUAN or CURR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenddic_builtin_types.htm) with length 31 and 14 decimal places.

### Session Variables 
When a CDS view is accessed using ABAP SQL, three session variables ([$session.user, $session.client, and $session.system_language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_session_variable_v1.htm)) can be accessed here. In these variables, the values of the system fields sy-uname, sy-mandt and sy-langu are available. 

### Annotation for Input Parameters
An input parameter of a CDS view or a CDS table function can now be annotated with an annotation [@Environment.systemField](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_f1_parameter_annotations.htm). The potential values of the annotation assign ABAP system fields to the input parameters. If a CDS entity of this type is used a [data source](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abapselect_data_source.htm) in ABAP SQL, the assigned values can be passed implicitly. In particular, the value [#CLIENT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_f1_parameter_annotations.htm) enables the client ID of the current client to be passed implicitly, which provides support for client handling in Native SQL of the implementation of a CDS table function. 

### API for Evaluation of Annotations 
The class CL_DD_DDL_ANNOTATION_SERVICE contains methods for evaluating the annotations of CDS entities. 

### Exposing CDS Associations 
Path expressions can now be published with more than one association in the [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_select_list_v1.htm) of a CDS view. The fields of the source data source from the ON condition of the published associated, which then also need to be specified, must be defined using an appropriately specified path. 

### Extensions 
The statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_extend_view.htm) for CDS DDIC-based view extensions was expanded as follows:

- [Associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_association_v1.htm) for the SELECT statement of the extended CDS view can now be specified after EXTEND VIEW.
- The following can now be specified in the extension list select_list_extension:
	- Input parameters of the extended CDS view
	- [Path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_path_expression_v1.htm) for custom associations and for associations of the extended CDS view
	- [Special functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_special_functions_v1.htm)

### CDS Views with Input Parameters 
In ABAP release 7.50 and higher, the input parameters of CDS views are supported by all database platforms and can be used in ABAP SQL. It is no longer necessary to query property VIEWS_WITH_PARAMETERS using method USE_FEATURES of class [CL_ABAP_DBFEATURES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abencl_abap_dbfeatures.htm). Querying this property results in a warning check from the syntax check. 

## [AMDP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abennews-750-amdp.htm)
### AMDP Table Functions
Alongside the existing AMDP procedures, the AMDP framework now also supports AMDP functions in the form of table functions in the SAP HANA database. AMDP now have the new addition [BY DATABASE FUNCTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abapmethod_by_db_proc.htm) of the statement `#!ABAP METHOD` in implementations of [AMDP methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenamdp_method_glosry.htm) in AMDP classes. These methods are known as AMDP function implementations to distinguish them from the existing AMDP procedure implementations. Unlike [AMDP procedure implementations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenamdp_function_method_glosry.htm), AMDP function implementations have a tabular return value, but cannot be called like regular functional methods in ABAP. 

### AMDP Table Functions for AMDP Methods
In other [AMDP methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenamdp_method_glosry.htm) and using the associated Native SQL syntax, it is possible to access the [AMDP function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenamdp_function_glosry.htm) of an [AMDP function implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenamdp_function_method_glosry.htm) with an explicitly defined parameter interface 

### AMDP Table Functions for CDS Table Functions
 An AMDP function implementation in whose declaration the addition [FOR TABLE FUNCTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abapclass-methods_for_tabfunc.htm) is specified implements a CDS table function from ABAP CDS. The parameter interface of an AMDP function implementation of this type is specified by the definition of the CDS table function. The associated AMDP function is executed as a data source of an ABAP SQL read statement when accessing the CDS table function directly or indirectly. 

## [ABAP Unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abennews-750-abap_unit.htm)
### Test Seams and Injections
[Test seams](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abentest_seam_glosry.htm) and [injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninjection_glosry.htm) have been introduced for unit tests in ABAP Unit. When tests are executed, code wrapped in [TEST-SEAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abaptest-seam.htm) and [END-TEST-SEAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abapend-test-seam.htm) as part of production code can be replaced by code from test classes wrapped by [TEST-INJECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abaptest-injection.htm) and [END-TEST-INJECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abapend-test-injection.htm).

Test classes with injections must be created in [test includes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abentest_include_glosry.htm) :fontawesome-solid-triangle-exclamation:. With the exception of test includes for class pools and function groups, no test includes can currently be created. 

## [ABAP Versions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abennews-750-abap_versions.htm)
### Dynamic Destinations in RFC 
The methods of the class CL_DYNAMIC_DESTINATION are used to manage dynamic [RFC destinations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrfc_destination.htm) in ABAP release 7.50 and higher. In particular, the method CREATE_RFC_DESTINATION makes it possible to create a dynamic destination, which can be used in the current sessions for RFCs. 

### Point-to-Point Communication for AMC
Alongside the general publish-and-subscribe mechanism, a point-to-point communication option was introduced for the [ABAP messaging channels (AMC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenamc.htm). Here, a sender object addresses precisely one receiver session. The send action can be either synchronous or asynchronous. This is done using the new factory method CREATE_MESSAGE_PRODUCER_BY_ID of the class CL_AMC_CHANNEL_MANAGER. The ID of a receiver session is provided by the method GET_CONSUMER_SESSION_ID of the same class. 

### Enhancements for APC
The framework for [ABAP channels](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenapc.htm) was expanded as follows:

- Alongside communication using the WebSocket protocol, communication using TCP sockets is now also possible.
- An AS ABAP used as an APC server can now also stateful. Until now, only stateless servers were possible.
- An AS ABAP as operate as an APC client.
- Clients known as detached clients make it possible to open an APC connection to a stateless or stateful APC server and then detach it again immediately so that it can be accessed using attached clients.
- A connection handle can be used to access existing APC connections across the entire system.
- A [non-blocking](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenapc_non_blocking_model.htm) model was introduced for stateful APC applications.
- The class CL_APC_TIMER_MANAGER creates timer managers that can be accessed using the interface IF_APC_TIMER_MANAGER. A timer manager makes it possible to start and stop a timer in stateful APC applications in which the statement WAIT is not allowed. The interface IF_APC_TIMER_HANDLER is used to handle timer events.

### Forbidden Accesses for APC
Up to now, any repeated attempts to bind a push channel to a bound messaging channel or any attempts to remove a nonexistent binding were ignored. From ABAP release 7.50, both situations raise an exception. 

## [Further Changes in ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abennews-750-others.htm)
### Specifying the Logon Language in SUBMIT VIA JOB
The new addition LANGUAGE of the statement [SUBMIT VIA JOB](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abapsubmit_via_job.htm) makes it possible to set the logon language of the background session, which was previously only possible when using the function module JOB_SUBMIT directly. 

### Results Table in ADBC
The method SET_PARAM_TABLE of the class CL_SQL_STATEMENT, used to access sets in [ADBC queries](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenadbc_query.htm), now accepts sorted and hashed tables as well as standard tables.

### Short Texts in ABAP Doc
It is now possible to define short texts in ABAP comments and synchronize them with the short texts of methods and function modules in ABAP Workbench. 

### Full Text Search in the Web Version of the ABAP Keyword Documentation
Quotation marks (") can be placed around a search term in the input fields of the Web version of the ABAP keyword documentation to force a full text search. If there are no quotation marks, an index search is performed and a full text search is made only if the index search does not find any hits.

The full text search option has been available in the dialog box of the SAP GUI Version of the ABAP keyword documentation for some time now using radio buttons. From ABAP release 7.50, SP02 this function can also be accessed using quotation marks (") to enter a search term in the documentation display input field.
