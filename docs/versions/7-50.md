# ABAP changelog [7.50](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abennews-750.htm)

## [ABAP Unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abennews-750-abap_unit.htm)
### Test Seams and Injections
[Test seams](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abentest_seam_glosry.htm) and [injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninjection_glosry.htm) have been introduced for unit tests in ABAP Unit. When tests are executed, code wrapped in [TEST-SEAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abaptest-seam.htm) and [END-TEST-SEAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abapend-test-seam.htm) as part of production code can be replaced by code from test classes wrapped by [TEST-INJECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abaptest-injection.htm) and [END-TEST-INJECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abapend-test-injection.htm).

Test classes with injections must be created in [test includes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abentest_include_glosry.htm) :fontawesome-solid-triangle-exclamation:. With the exception of test includes for class pools and function groups, no test includes can currently be created. 

## [ABAP Versions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abennews-750-abap_versions.htm)
### Dynamic Destinations in RFC 
The methods of the class CL_DYNAMIC_DESTINATION are used to manage dynamic [RFC destinations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrfc_destination.htm) in ABAP release 7.50 and higher. In particular, the method CREATE_RFC_DESTINATION makes it possible to create a dynamic destination, which can be used in the current sessions for RFCs. 

### Point-to-Point Communication for AMC
Alongside the general publish-and-subscribe mechanism, a point-to-point communication option was introduced for the [ABAP messaging channels (AMC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenamc.htm). Here, a sender object addresses precisely one receiver session. The send action can be either synchronous or asynchronous. This is done using the new factory method CREATE_MESSAGE_PRODUCER_BY_ID of the class CL_AMC_CHANNEL_MANAGER. The ID of a receiver session is provided by the method GET_CONSUMER_SESSION_ID of the same class. 

### Enhancements for APC
The framework for [ABAP channels](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenapc.htm) was expanded as follows:

- Alongside communication using the WebSocket protocol, communication using TCP sockets is now also possible.
- An AS ABAP used as an APC server can now also stateful. Until now, only stateless servers were possible.
- An AS ABAP as operate as an APC client.
- Clients known as detached clients make it possible to open an APC connection to a stateless or stateful APC server and then detach it again immediately so that it can be accessed using attached clients.
- A connection handle can be used to access existing APC connections across the entire system.
- A [non-blocking](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenapc_non_blocking_model.htm) model was introduced for stateful APC applications.
- The class CL_APC_TIMER_MANAGER creates timer managers that can be accessed using the interface IF_APC_TIMER_MANAGER. A timer manager makes it possible to start and stop a timer in stateful APC applications in which the statement WAIT is not allowed. The interface IF_APC_TIMER_HANDLER is used to handle timer events.

### Forbidden Accesses for APC
Up to now, any repeated attempts to bind a push channel to a bound messaging channel or any attempts to remove a nonexistent binding were ignored. From ABAP release 7.50, both situations raise an exception. 

## [Further Changes in ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abennews-750-others.htm)
### Specifying the Logon Language in SUBMIT VIA JOB
The new addition LANGUAGE of the statement [SUBMIT VIA JOB](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abapsubmit_via_job.htm) makes it possible to set the logon language of the background session, which was previously only possible when using the function module JOB_SUBMIT directly. 

### Results Table in ADBC
The method SET_PARAM_TABLE of the class CL_SQL_STATEMENT, used to access sets in [ADBC queries](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenadbc_query.htm), now accepts sorted and hashed tables as well as standard tables.

### Short Texts in ABAP Doc
It is now possible to define short texts in ABAP comments and synchronize them with the short texts of methods and function modules in ABAP Workbench. 

### Full Text Search in the Web Version of the ABAP Keyword Documentation
Quotation marks (") can be placed around a search term in the input fields of the Web version of the ABAP keyword documentation to force a full text search. If there are no quotation marks, an index search is performed and a full text search is made only if the index search does not find any hits.

The full text search option has been available in the dialog box of the SAP GUI Version of the ABAP keyword documentation for some time now using radio buttons. From ABAP release 7.50, SP02 this function can also be accessed using quotation marks (") to enter a search term in the documentation display input field.
